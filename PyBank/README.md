# Main.ipynb: P&L Analysis 
#### The P&L Analysis was written to find the following. I used a range of resources online and also hired a python tutor to help work through it to explain some of the fundamental concepts, such as understanding how to use dictionary keys and values appropriately, to reading the file and final support on writing the file as csv. 
| Goal no. |Goal        |

| 1 | Finding the total number of months in the data set| 
| 2 | The total revenue generated throughout the period | 
| 3 | The average change between two months | 
| 4 | The greatest increase in profits | 
| 5 | the greatest decrease in profits | 

#### With the help from: Stackoverflow, W3Schools, TutorialSpoint, GeekdsforGeeks and Edward Rees, I was able to read & write a csv file.
